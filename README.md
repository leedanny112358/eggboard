# Running Eggboard on a local machine

This project uses the Node.js environment to run our application using React and Express. Firstly, you will need to have a clone of this repository as well as the backend repository which can be found at https://github.com/leedanny112358/eggboard-backend. Then, you can run the following

### 'cd eggboard'

### 'npm install'

### 'npm start

### 'cd ..'

### 'cd eggboard-backend"

### 'npm install'

### 'npm run dev'

Afterwards, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view eggboard in the browser. The backend MySQL databse resides on the cloud via heroku.
